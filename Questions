1. I have no questions.
2. UML Diagram
3. Polymorphism is used in the AbstractRectangle class that allows the ability to create basic rectangles with basic actions.
4. The program preforms animation by updating the DrawingArea every 10 ticks, while also calling the AbstractRectangle.act() method to change where and what the rectangle looks like on the display.
5. The benefits are that every class extending it will require an act() method.
6. The AbstractRectangle class would have to extend Shape not Rectangle.
